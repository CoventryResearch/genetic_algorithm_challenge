Data files, code, and results for Genetic Algorithm Challenge by @Sirajology on Youtube



The Challenge
=============
Use the TPOT library to make a discovery based on a question you pose. The question should be based on the Kaggle Climate Change Dataset (compiled from Berkeley Earth), but you get to choose the question. 



My Approach
============
The Climate Change Dataset on Kaggle contains several files with data for land and ocean temperatures both globally and locally. My question was: What will the monthly global average temperatures be for the next 5 years?

I chose to use the file GlobalTemperatures.csv, which contains global average land temperatures in celsius for each month from 1750-2015.
